                        <p>If a wild pigeon appears healthy, <b>do not bother them.</b>
                            If you intend to feed them, though bread is the most popular choice, 
                            it is not as nutri-<br>tious for birds. Feed dried corn, peas, and seeds. 
                            Suppose a wild pigeon is hurt or sick. In that case, you can identify 
                            this by lethargy, irregular flapping of wings but no flight, visible 
                            signs of injury such as a broken leg or blood, or the extended head 
                            retraction into the body as the bird is sitting. </p>
                            
                        <p> First and foremost, you should prioritize the stress levels of the bird.
                            Ensure that they are handled with the utmost care, and when moved, must 
                            not be around noise, bright lights, or predatory animals. Do not treat 
                            the wild bird as a domestic pet and touch them excessively, as it may 
                            increase stress. The point of care at this point can take two routes:
                            professional care and personal care. It is best to surrender the bird 
                            to wildlife authorities, such as an avian veterinarian, an exotic 
                            veterin-<br>arian, or a wildlife rehabilitation center. If the bird has any 
                            visible physical injuries, especially blood, or if they present neurological 
                            issues (wobbliness), they especially fall into this category. If you are 
                            considering personal care, proceed to the following points: </p>
                            

                        <p> After you transfer the pigeon into a cage/shoebox, <b>away from noise, any 
                            danger, and in a dimly lit room,</b> ensure further comfort by placing a warm 
                            towel with them. Warmth is especially important if you rescue a baby pigeon, 
                            which can be identified by their baldness, small size, and thick, spiky downy 
                            feathers that will eventually be replaced by adult feathers. In such a situation, 
                            they need a parent to warm them up, thus, the extra towels and a heating pad set 
                            on low beneath them or under the cage itself will be beneficial. </p>
                            
                        <p> Before feeding, ensure that the pigeon can drink water. <b>Baby pigeons require 
                            crop milk from their parents.</b> Crop milk replacement can be bought online, though 
                            some avian veterinarians may carry it. If you are looking for a more affordable 
                            option, this can be made using ground oats, a quarter of a boiled egg, and water. 
                            Grind or blend the dry mat-<br>erials into a paste before adding water and mixing. 
                            The final result should have a soup-like consistency. Feed this mixture using a 
                            feeding<br>/oral syringe. Once the bird has eaten, attempt to feed it some seeds. 
                            Pre-mixes can be bought that include a healthy variety such as corn, peas, red milo, 
                            safflower, millet, and hard red wheat. Minced vegetables are recommended as well. 
                            Ensure continued access to clean, warm water after the meal. <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>If the pigeon is not eating, 
                            this requires immediate professional attention,</b> as pigeons have a high metabolism 
                            and eat very often.  <b>For baby pigeons, look out for crop stasis,</b> an occurrence when 
                            the food sits at the top for too long if the food is too thick or cold or if the 
                            bird itself is too cold when fed. This can lead the bird to become sick and pass away. 
                            To avoid this, check the crop (the area from the lower chest to the underbelly) to 
                            determine if it is emptying. You will be able to feel the food or its weight with 
                            your fingers. </p>
                            
                        <p> <b>Make sure to ask veterinarians or a wildlife center if problems arise,</b> or a community 
                            such as pigeon/bird owner forums. After the pigeon regains its health, as your local 
                            wildlife center if a release is recommended. If so, take the pigeon to an open, empty, 
                            outdoor space and allow it to take its time to fly off. If the pigeon appears to have 
                            become attached to you and especially reliant, congratulations! You have a new companion. </p>

                            <p>Domesticated pigeons—not feral—cannot live without human care. 
                                According to the Open Sanctuary Project, escaped or abandoned 
                                "racing pigeons are often found with injuries or starving" 
                                    because "they have never learned how to survive without 
                                    human support."</p>
                                
                            <p> The food required includes pigeon feed and vegetables in general. 
                                As for babies, alongside the previous items, they must be fed using 
                                a formula of <b></b>crop replacement and water,</b> or an affordable solution 
                                using <b>ground oats, a quarter of a boiled egg, and water.</b> Grind or

                                using a feeding<br>/oral syringe. Regardless of indoor and outdoor keeping, 
                                domestic pigeons need <b>water for drinking that must be changed daily,</b> 
                                and water in a shallow basin for baths.</p>
                                
                                
                            <p> <b>Indoor</b><br>
                                Indoor pigeon owners often own one 1-2 birds. They are kept in cages 
                                <br>and can roam around the house to aid in both the bird's happiness and brain development. <br>
                                <br>
                                If you are concerned with defecation, <b>pigeon pants</b> can be bought and be 
                                easily attached to the bird, holding poop away from the body of the bird 
                                to avoid mess. <b>They must always be cleaned</b> and can come with a leash if 
                                you are planning on leaving the house with them. <br>
                                <br>
                                You are also able to treat them as normal pets, as they are incredibly 
                                smart and can be taught tricks. </p>
                                
                            <p> <b>Outdoor</b><br>
                                Outdoor pigeon owners often have multiple pigeons to breed, race, collect, 
                                or enter competitions with. They can be kept together regard-<br>less of breed as 
                                they are not hostile with one another, but it must be noted that <b>they can mate 
                                for life and produce offspring</b> if they are of the opposite sex. If you would 
                                like to avoid this, you can keep them in separate shelters, whether you are 
                                categorizing them by breed, sex, or both. <b>Separating mated pairs is unwise as 
                                the birds can become depressed,</b> so if you would like to prevent the production 
                                of eggs, you can buy fake plastic ones and place them into their nest to trick them. <br>
                                <br>
                                In terms of the shelters themselves, you are able to buy them online or from other 
                                people, or can build one yourself. Layouts and scale depend on how many you intend to raise. <br>
                                <br>
                                The interior should at least have places for the pigeons to perch, nests, a basin 
                                for drinking water, a shallow basin of water to bathe in, bedding during the colder 
                                months (hay, hemp, straw), and a flooring of wood or concrete under a dirt floor to 
                                prevent predators from tunneling under the walls and into the cage. <br>
                                <br>
                                The exterior should be secured with heavy-duty mesh chicken wire. This should look 
                                like a grid of small squares instead of large hexagonal holes to ensure that no predators 
                                can reach into the shelter.
