                    The original pigeon is a rock dove, Columba livia, 
                    part of the Columbidae family, and is the ancestor 
                    of current domestic pigeons, Columba livia domestica.

                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>
                    Humans have continuously bred domestic 
                    pigeons for millennia, resulting in a 
                    variety of colours and physical <br> traits. 
                    As domestic birds have escaped, they found 
                    their <br> way back to wild groups, adding a 
                    variety of colours to groups rather than 
                    just pale grey bodies, dark bands across the 
                    wings, and green and purple feathers along the
                    neck and chest area. This mix has resulted 
                    in the feral hybrids that populate large 
                    cityscapes today.

                <b>Beginnings of Domestication</b><br>
                The cultivation of pigeons were found to be inscribed on artifacts 
                from Ancient Mesopotamia and in Egyptian hieroglyphics from around 
                4500 <br> BC. The earliest known use of “pigeon post” is credited to 
                ancient Egypt around 1350 BC as messengers for the military, or to 
                communicate <br> the news of the Nile’s flooding, something vital <br> 
                for agriculture. Pigeons were also used for <br> similarly in ancient 
                Mesopotamia and Persia.

                <b>44 BC-96AD</b><br>
                Pigeons were used in Rome for food, racing, and communication. 
                In 44-43 BC, pigeons were used at the siege of Mutina, in which
                the Senate refused Mark Anthony’s wishes to remove Decimus Brutus
                <br>(an assassin of Caesar) from power in exchange for the governorship
                of Cisalpine Gaul. It was Mark Antony who launched the siege. In 
                Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, written in 77 A.D., he mentions
                how Brutus attached despatches to the camp of the consuls. Later,
                in a treatise on military strategies in Frontinus’ Stratagems,
                around 84-96 A.D., he credits Brutus’ ally Hiritius for their usage 
                as well. He says, “Hirtius also shut up pigeons in the dark, starved 
                them, fastened letters to their necks by a hair, and then released 
                them as near to the city walls as he could. The birds, eager for light
                and food, sought the highest buildings and were received by Brutus,
                who in that way was informed of everything, especially after he set 
                food in certain spots and taught the pigeons to alight there.”

                <b>1368-1644 vs The Modern Age</b><br>
                As in other cultures, pigeons were used in the Chinese Ming Dynasty’s army 
                as couriers; however, they were banned during its cultural revolution as they 
                were seen as too capitalist. In the more modern era, however, they made a 
                resurgence in the 1970s. There is a large demand for pigeons from Chinese buyers, 
                whether for companionship, racing, or lux-<br>ury goods. Today, 300,000 citizens are 
                involved in pigeon racing, some competing in competitions <br> with a prize of millions 
                of dollars.

                <b>19th Century</b><br>
                These beloved birds were greatly prized among royalty as pets and were a privilege to 
                cultivate. This affection continued well into the Victorian era, when England was the 
                capital of pigeon fancying. There were even attempts to protect the craft, though they 
                eventually became associated with <br> the poor rather than the bourgeois. 
                <br><br>
                Pigeon racing as a sport began in Belgium in 1818, where the first 
                long-distance race was held, stre-<br>tching more than 160km. Its popularity 
                eventually sprouted a Société Colombophile/Pigeon-fanciers Club in almost 
                every village in the country, while the sport itself giained popularity 
                in Great Britain, the United States, and France in the late 1800s. Other 
                than sports, pigeons were once again used as messengers in Europe during 
                the Revolution in 1848 and the telegraphic interruptions between Berlin and 
                Brussels in 1849.

                <b>20th Century</b><br>
                  In 1907, a German apothecary Dr. Julius Neubronner patented a timed camera that could
                  be attached to a pigeon for arial photographs to be taken in flight and with ease, at great
                  ditances and speeds. Truly <br> a precursor to modern day drones! He initially dev<br>-eloped 
                  this to track the flights of his own homing pigeons which were used to deliver perscriptions, but this led to the astounding
                  achievement of some of the earliest images taken of the Earth from atop. <br> This technology
                  would be further developed for war efforts to document events and spy on enemies.

                  In both World Wars, carrier pigeons were not <br> only used for strategic 
                  communication, but were sometimes a last plea for help from cornered, 
                  injured, and stranded soldiers. During World War <br> II, under the AAF, 
                  homing pigeons transmitted a myriad of messages, ult-imately contributing 
                  greatly to the Allied war effort. 32 pigeons were later decorated with 
                  the Dickin Medal. Despite completing their missions, many retained injuries 
                  <br> or died from exhaustion or being shot by enemies.
